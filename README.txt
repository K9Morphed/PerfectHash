****PERFECT HASHING****

Welcome to my small corner of the universe.

This program, perfectHash.java, was a submission for a university assignment.

perfectHash.java takes in two inputs, a .txt file containing numeric data and a .txt file containing operations related to that numeric data, and outputs the hash table after perfect hashing to the terminal.

I've included some example data and operations, listed below. Please note that a pair of data and operation files MUST be used together, they get upset if you mix 'n' match.

TEST FILES
-----------

1) testData1.txt && testOp1.txt
2) testData2.txt && testOp2.txt

NOTE: This program was created as part of a university assignment. The implementation may not be perfect, however testing has proven that it works with the majority of inputs.
